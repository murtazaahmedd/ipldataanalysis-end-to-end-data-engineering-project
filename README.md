# IPL Data Analysis with Apache Spark

In this project, we analyze Indian Premier League (IPL) data by building a robust data pipeline. Our primary focus is on writing Apache Spark code and implementing various functions to perform data transformations. This repository contains all the necessary scripts and documentation to help you understand and replicate the data analysis process.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction**: Methods to fetch and store IPL data.
- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques to clean and preprocess the raw data.
- **Data Transformation**: Implementation of Apache Spark code to transform and manipulate data efficiently.
- **Data Analysis**: Analytical functions to derive insights from the data.

## Requirements

- Apache Spark
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive analysis)
- 
## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Follow the scripts in the `notebooks` or `scripts` directory to perform data extraction, cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
